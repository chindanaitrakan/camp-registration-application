## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the Object-Oriented concepts that we have learnt in this module by implementing a Camp Application and Management System (CAMs).
The concepts include both code wise, as well as good coding practices and SOLID principles. (elaborated in the report). 
In our project, we have followed the requirements strictly, as well as included additional features to make the user interface and user experience more pleasant.

## Getting Started

This project is coded with Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.7+8-LTS-224) and ran on Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Version: 2023-06 (4.28.0).

##### Importing into Eclipse:
To run the application, click on "Import..." in the Project Explorer and select "Projects From Folder or Archive".
Select the folder that we have uploaded onto NTU Learn.

##### Include External Libraries:
Before running the program, there is a need to include external libraries: Apache POI -> poi-bin-5.2.3-20220909.zip (https://archive.apache.org/dist/poi/release/bin/).
After downloading it, extract the file. 
Go back into Eclipse, and right click on the Project folder -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path...
In the Build Path page, click on the Libraries tab -> Class Paths -> Add external JARS... -> Select all the files that end with .jar in the extracted folder downloaded earlier.

##### Running the Program:
Under the folder, navigate to the following:
src -> main -> MainApp.java

Run MainApp.java
